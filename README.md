The cost of healthcare insurance is higher in the United States compared to many other developed nations (Frakt et al, 2018). Healthcare costs are expected to increase by 5.5 % annually on average from 2017 to 2026 (Abutaleb, 2018). In this study, we are investigating whether there are any significant associations between certain demographic characteristics of an individual and the annual cost of healthcare charged to them. The hypothesis of our study aims to find whether characteristics such as whether a person is a smoker,the number of children they have,their sex, geographic region,  BMI (Body Mass Index) or age are significantly associated with the annual healthcare insurance cost. Initially, we attempted to construct linear models. However, we could not make conclusions about which of the predictors are significant because the model violated conditions of normality and homoscedasticity. Therefore, we generated bootstrap distributions for each of the predictors that we had initially considered. Using the bootstrap distribution, we conclude that the characteristics which are significantly associated with the cost of healthcare insurance are: whether a person is a smoker, their age, their BMI, their region of residence and the number of children they have.
